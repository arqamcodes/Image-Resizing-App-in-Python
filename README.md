# Image-Resizing-App-in-Python
I have recently completed my second Python project, which is a basic image resizing application. This project serves the purpose of resizing images based on the provided code. The program accepts an image file within a specified folder directory and resizes it, generating a new image file in formats such as JPG, PNG, or others as desired.
